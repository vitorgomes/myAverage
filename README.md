This repository is for an application i am developing for my mentoring program

Hello all,

I am developing a kind of school application that register students, subjects and their grades in Swift language.
You can add students to the app, and add them to subjects, also register which grade on their registered subjects. At final, application should return student average at school.
Students can be registered on N subjects and subjects can have N students registered. It's about a many-to-many relation on CoreData.
